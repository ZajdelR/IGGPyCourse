    "## What we commonly refer to as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is actually machine learning, or even deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term has been adopted in everyday language, but it is imprecise. AI is a much broader field, also encompassing robotics and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The goal of AI is to build a being that reasons like a human. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Building such a being involves replicating all the elements necessary for interacting with the environment. Most of these elements we replicate quite well – this refers to motor skills and object manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this as replicating specific body parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Legs for movement\n",
    "    Hands for manipulation\n",
    "    <b>The brain for reasoning and inference</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The ambition of machine learning is to create a component essential for an intelligent being, i.e., an artificial brain. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/mozg.jpg' width=300/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the brain has been an inspiration for some machine learning algorithms over the years, especially neural networks, which are revolutionizing the modern world. The structure of neurons and their connections was the foundation for the development of the first learned model. This happened as early as 1958. Then followed the so-called AI winter, during which little research in this area took place. This was mainly due to a lack of computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vision of replicating the brain, though tempting, is still distant. The complexity of current algorithms is far smaller than that of our brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms are primarily trained to perform a single task; they are unable to generalize tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many areas, the capabilities of algorithms surpass those of our brains.\n",
    "<img src='img/chiuaua.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are much better at performing a variety of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For a machine learning algorithm to recognize an elephant, it first needs to see 1,000 images of elephants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A child, on the other hand, can learn to recognize an elephant flawlessly from a single illustrated picture in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A person who learned to drive in sunny weather will likely manage reasonably well driving on a snowy road.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An algorithm that has never seen a snowy road will likely \"panic\" and fail to take any action.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## What is the future of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are becoming increasingly versatile and capable of performing tasks quickly and efficiently. A good example is the popular large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, showing how capable these tools are becoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Are machine learning models aware or can they become aware?\n",
    "    What is their future?\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of \"singularity\" refers to the creation of so-called General Artificial Intelligence (General AI), which is capable of performing all assigned tasks intelligently. Such intelligence is capable of self-improvement, evolving far beyond our imagination and control. This raises a frequent question about consciousness – when can we consider algorithms to be conscious?\n",
    "\n",
    "Already today, models are pushing the boundaries of knowledge, finding solutions to problems so efficient that they surpass human reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, matrix multiplication has been performed using the Strassen method, which had been the most efficient method of this operation since 1969. In 2022, AlphaTensor developed its own method of matrix multiplication, requiring fewer operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perhaps machine learning is the next revolution in human history.\n",
    "<img src='img/revol.jpg'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each revolution is characterized by a change in lifestyle, raising its quality but also altering the way the world functions. These changes must be conducted responsibly and are always met with resistance. Ethics is a key issue. Some professions will likely disappear and be automated. But new ones will emerge.\n"
